# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a study guide for the boot camp prework. My motivation was to help fellow students succeed in their training. I did this in order to help alleviate any confusion about the topics they'll be tasked with learning. This website provides the student with an example of what is expected from them and what they are capable of. Through this project I learned that development isn't difficult if you have detailed instruction and take your time.
